            <p> <strong>Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles found in the dermis.</strong><em>Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals.</em> The human body, apart from areas of glabrous skin, is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair. Most common interest in hair is focused on hair growth, hair types, and hair care, but hair is also an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein, notably alpha-keratin.

                Attitudes towards different forms of hair, such as hairstyles and hair removal, vary widely across different cultures and historical periods, but it is often used to indicate a person's personal beliefs or social position, such as their age, sex, or religion.

            <p><a href="services.html#sign"></a>Each strand of hair is made up of the medulla, cortex, and cuticle.[4] The innermost region, the medulla, is an open and unstructured region which is not always present.[5] The highly structural and organized cortex, or second of three layers of the hair, is the primary source of mechanical strength and water uptake. The cortex contains melanin, which colors the fiber based on the number, distribution and types of melanin granules.  </p>
